This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: creating data races by having multiple mutable references to the same value.  The `bug.rs` file showcases the problematic code, resulting in undefined behavior and potentially unpredictable results. The solution, in `bugSolution.rs`, illustrates how to avoid this issue by using techniques like interior mutability or by restructuring the code to avoid the need for multiple mutable borrows simultaneously.
